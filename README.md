# master-lock-word-list

I bought a cheap [Master Lock 643DASTWD](https://www.masterlock.com/products/product/643DASTWD) for at the Gym and was curious what word combinations were possible.

I used the python3 [pyenchant](https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant/) module to check if a word was in the English language.

There were a total of 771 words.
